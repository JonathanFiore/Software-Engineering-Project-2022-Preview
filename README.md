## Implemented Functionalities
<br/>

| Functionality | Status|
|:---------------:|:----------:|
|Simplified Rules|游릭|
|Complete Rules|游릭|
|Socket|游릭|
|CLI|游릭| 
|GUI|游릭|
|All Character Cards|游릭|
|4 Players Game|游릭|
|Multiple Games|游릭|
|Persistence|游댮|
|Disconnection Resilience|游댮|

<br/>

The implemented extra functionalities are:
- **All Character Cards**: in the expert mode, all the 12 Character are available.
- **4 Players Game**: the first player can choose to start a game between four players, divided into two teams.
- **Multiple Games**: the Serves can manage multiple games at the same time. This funcionality is implemented as follows:
  - once the client sends a join request to the server, if there's no game created yet, a new one is created and the player is added to that game.
  - if there's a game whose number of players have not been decided yet, the player is added to that game only if they were the second one to join it.
  -  if there's a game whose number of players have already been decided, the player is added only if there is an available slot for that game.
  - in any other case, a new game is created and the player is added to it.

## Documentation

In  the  folder  **[deliveries](https://github.com/JonathanFiore/SoftwareEngineeringProject2022/tree/main/deliveries)** there's the project's documentation, complete with: initial and final **class diagrams**, **communication protocol**, sent and received **peer reviews**.

  
### UML

The project's class  diagrams  in  the  Unified  Modelling  Language can be found in the following folders:


-  **[Initial  UML](https://github.com/JonathanFiore/SoftwareEngineeringProject2022/tree/main/deliveries/uml/initialUML)**

-  **[Final  UML](https://github.com/JonathanFiore/SoftwareEngineeringProject2022/tree/main/deliveries/uml/finalUML)**



### Communication Protocol

The communication protocol can be found **[here](https://github.com/JonathanFiore/SoftwareEngineeringProject2022/blob/main/deliveries/protocol_documentation.pdf)**.

<br/>

## Compiling and Packaging
The jars are built with Maven Shade Plugin.
To compile the jars, use this command in the project root folder:
```
mvn package
```
The jars will be placed into the folder ```target``` and named ```Client.jar``` and ```Server.jar```.

<br/>

## Execution Instructions

  The jars can be found **[here](https://github.com/JonathanFiore/SoftwareEngineeringProject2022/tree/main/deliveries/jar)**.

  

  ### Server
  To execute the Server, use the following command:
  ```
  java -jar Server.jar
  ```
  
_NB. the Server will open automatically on port number: **12345**_



  ### Client
  To execute the Client, use the following command:
  ```
  java -jar Client.jar
  ```
 
 Then, once the following line is shown: 
 
```
Choose CLI[0] or GUI[1]
```

press ```0``` to play using the CLI or press ```1``` to play using the GUI.

_NB: to properly play using the CLI on Windows, it is necessary to install **[Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=it-it&gl=IT)** , because Windows CMD doesn't support special Unicode characters._
